# Horizon Worlds Parts-Based Animation (HWPBA)

Lightweight tools + workflow for building parts-based animated characters in Horizon Worlds. Export from Blender → upload FBXs + a single Text Asset → drive animations in HW with a small script.

## Watch the tutorials

Two short series walk through the pipeline end-to-end:

1) Robot — intro to parts-based animation, auto-rigging, animation, importing assets, and playing an animation.
